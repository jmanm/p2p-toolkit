# p2p-toolkit

P2P Toolkit is a general-purpose SDK for building peer-to-peer applications. It consists of:

* [Aquadoggo](https://github.com/jmanm/aquadoggo) - a back-end node for storing data and replicating to other peers
* [AquadoggoClient](https://github.com/jmanm/p2p-toolkit/blob/main/packages/toolkit/AquadoggoClient.ts) - a Typescript RPC client
allowing ORM-like querying of the node data.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
